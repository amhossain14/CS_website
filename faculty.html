				<p>UNO is the classic card game of matching colors and numbers that is easy to pick up…impossible to put down and now comes with customizable Wild Cards for added excitement! Players take turns racing to get rid of all their cards by matching a card in their hand with the current card shown on top of the deck either by color or number. Special Action cards deliver game-changing moments and help defeat opponents! Use the Swap Hands card to change hands with any other opponent and write your own rules using the 3 customizable (and erasable) Wild Cards! You’ll find 19 of each color (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus 8 Draw Two, Reverse and Skip cards in every color, along with 4 Wild Cards, 4 Wild Draw Four cards, 1 Wild Swap Hands Card and 3 Wild Customizable cards.
